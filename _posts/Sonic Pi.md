title: My Music Project
---
The goal of this project was to make a music as enjoyable as possible. This project was done by people who did not have knowledge in the field of music and designed this music only according to their taste.
The original idea for doing this was to initially write a program that would produce music randomly using fixed patterns.
To do so I decided to use Adele's song, Hello, Beat and tried to change it as much as I could.
Definitely by spending more time it could get way better.
